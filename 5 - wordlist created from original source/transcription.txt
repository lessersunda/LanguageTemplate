Please fill in the form as given in the source (same orthography/transcription
convention) in the corresponding column.

We can generate normalized IPA (“Form”), segmented, transcriptions (“Segments”),
and local “Orthography” from those values if there is a systematic way to do so.
We are happy to take transcoder descriptions or non-colliding Search-and-Replace
descriptions to execute this step. (We can also understand and use python
functions, CLTS transcription systems or regular expression chains; we may
be able to support other ways, feel free to get in contact with the editors.)
