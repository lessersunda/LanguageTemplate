Please fill in the form as given in the source (same orthography/transcription
convention) in the “Form” column. If the source uses IPA and you have a hard
time entering IPA Unicode symbols, you may instead use X-SAMPA for transcription.

We can generate segmented, normalized IPA transcriptions (“Segments”) from those
values if there is a systematic way to do so. We are happy to take
Search-and-Replace descriptions, python functions, CLTS transcription systems or
regular expression chains to execute this step; we may be able to support other
ways, feel free to get in contact with the editors.

As expected result of the automatic transcription, as well as for individual
entries of the “Segments” column for those forms where that is not possible, we
would like to obtain data that matches the following as closely as you can
manage, for reasons of cross-linguistic comparison.

 • Phonetic segments are separated by spaces.

 • Symbols used are part of the International Phonetic Alphabet, with the
   function they have in it. (For example, [y] is a rounded central front vowel,
   not a palatal approximant.)

 NOTE: You may use X-SAMPA input instead of Unicode IPA for segments, if it is
       more convenient for you.

 NOTE: Brackets () are not valid IPA symbols. Please decide on one particular
       realization for the “Segments” column.

 • Glottal stops are written in the transcription where they appear in the
   produced sound. The distinction of glottal stops is relevant both for the
   phonology of some languages and for historical reconstruction and should be
   maintained.

 • Diphtongs are ideally transcribed as a normal vowel followed by a non-syllabic
   vowel, eg. [a i̯]. This allows other researchers to understand them as
   different segments for the purposes of cross-linguistic comparison eg. for
   historical reconstruction, but maintains the difference to vowel sequences, as
   seen eg. in Indonesian [l a . ʊ t].

 • Long vowels are transcribed with length symbol [oː], even when they are
   phonologically or diachronically two identical vowels.

 • Syllable stress is marked where available, even when it can be systematically
   derived.
