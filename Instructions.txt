Step 0: Copy the entire "0 - New Wordlist Template" folder into your favourite        working directory and rename it to the name of the language you are        working on.Step 1: Put a description of the source in the folder "1 - description of the        original source". You can choose whatever format is handy. Type a few        lines in Word, save a webpage to that folder, copy the Excel sheet        containing the metadata to here, whatever. Try to include as much        metadata as possible with only a small amount of work.Step 2: Make a digital version of the original source available here. Scan a        hard copy of the book and drop it inside "2 - original source", or run a        web grabber or the source website, or store a backup of the FLEx corpus.        If you can, create a link to a place where the original source is        available online. If the original source is really well available        elsewhere, or really huge, you may be able to justify skipping step 3.        In that case, please place a text document in "2 - original source" that        states your reasoning.Step 3: Formalize the source description. The folder "3 - normalized metadata of        original source" contains examples for various types of sources, from        fieldwork via published books to online databases. Take the one most        fitting for your type of source, open it in a text editor (eg. Notepad++        or notepad, not Word) and modify it to reflect the source.    NOTE: If you are familiar with BibTeX, you may use any of it to describe the          source. If you want to use non-standard fields or genres, get in          contact.    NOTE: If the source is published and has an entry on Glottolog (search via          http://glottolog.org/langdoc/complexquery), just copy the          BibTeX formatted citation from there.Step 4: Take the language template (Pick Excel or CSV, delete the other) inside        "4 - language metadata" and fill in name, location, description,        Glottocode and Isocode of the language or lects described in your        primary source as exactly as possible given the source and your        background knowledge.    NOTE: If you have dialect information on a higher level of detail than in          Glottolog, pick a Lect “ID” that is the next Glottocode above your          variety, plus the first four, five or six letters of the glossonym,          ie. the name of the variety as used in the source. (For field work          data, this may also be the name of the village where the language is          spoken.)    NOTE: We can infer the region from the geo-coordinates, you may leave the          “Region” column empty.    NOTE: If you have done fieldwork and filled in a cultural questionnaire for          our CultureRumah, put the name of your culture data file in the          “Culture” column for the appropriate language(s). Otherwise leave that          column empty.Step 5: Create the word list (Pick one of Excel or CSV, delete the other). Take        the word list template in "5 - wordlist created from original source"        and fill it in. Make sure that every separate form is on a separate row        in the word list, whether they express different concepts or are        synonyms. This means that you can give comments for each individual        form. You should choose whatever transcription the source uses for the        “Form” column. If you have a choice, your “Form”s should be in a        phonemic transcription which uniquely identifies the phonetic, segmented        transcription in “Segments”.    NOTE: If the source lists forms that are obvious minor variants of each          other, you are encouraged to pick one representative and add the          variants in the “Comment” column.    NOTE: Even if the source uses unconventional orthography for its          pranscription, preserve it in the “Form” column.    NOTE: Wherever the orthography for the “Form” column is very clean (the          segmented phonetic realisation is obvious from the form), you may          leave the “Segments” column empty. See "5 - wordlist created from          original source/transcription.txt" for details.    NOTE: If you leave the “Lect_ID” or “Concept_ID” fields empty, we assume you          mean “The same value as in the row above”. So, if you have synonyms          directly under each other, you may leave out their concept          identifiers. And if you fill in a word list with only one language,          put its “Lect_ID” (usually its Glottocode) in the first row. This          means that if it is easy to work with the source in that way, the          easiest way to include multiple word lists is to have them one above          the other in the table.    NOTE: You are allowed to reorder rows and columns as you wish. The importer          is only interested in the “Concept_ID”, “Lect_ID”, “Form”, “Segments”          and “Comment” columns and will IGNORE ALL OTHER COLUMNS. So if you          notice an error in eg. the “Elicitation Notes”, you need to contact          the editors or raise an issue on GitHub. Keep in mind that if you          re-order rows, you need to have all “Concept_ID” and “Lect_ID” filled,          otherwise you might mix up things.
