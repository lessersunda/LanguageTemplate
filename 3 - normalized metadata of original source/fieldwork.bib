% Example: This fictitious instance of field work specifies all fields we support for fieldwork.

% Please note that due to how the parsers work, authors are separated by "and", while all other groups are separated by "&" and can have comments after a "–". Detailed descriptions of speakers (and, where useful, other people) are desired, you may also provide sociolinguistic data on speakers in a format of your choosing.
