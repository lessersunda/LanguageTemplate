% Example 1: The ABVD states they want to be cited according to the describing article, so this provides that reference and a few metadata specific to a database.

@article{abvd,
    shorttitle = {ABVD},
    title = {The Austronesian Basic Vocabulary Database},
    subtitle = {From Bioinformatics to Lexomics},
    author = {Greenhill, Simon J. and Blust, Robert and Gray, Russel D.},
    year = {2008},
    journal = {Evolutionary Bioinformatics},
    issue = {4},
    pages = {271-283},

    url = {https://abvd.shh.mpg.de/austronesian/},
    license = {CC-BY 4.0},
    note = {Data from the online Austronesian Basic Vocabulary Database – Data

% Example 2: Glottolog is a publication of its own, and provides the items they want to see in a citation.

@online{glottolog,
    author = {Hammarström, Harald and Bank, Sebastian and Forkel, Robert and Haspelmath, Martin},
    year = {2018},
    title = {Glottolog 3.2},
